Folders:
SVD -- Implementation of the latent factor model with biasis.
SVD++ -- Extension of SVD, which takes implicit feedback into consideration.
timeSVD++ -- Extension of SVD++, which further takes temporal dynamics into consideration. And that's what we use.

More details can be found in the report and the codes.

Performance on the site provided for testing:
SVD -- approximately 0.91564
SVD++ -- approximately 0.91133
timeSVD++ -- approximately 0.904791

Files:
tool_used.txt -- List the tools we used.
5120309085_5120309016_5120309005.txt -- The rating predictions made for the test set.
SVD.h: Headerfile of the class SVD.
SVD.cpp: Implementations of the class SVD.
main.cpp: Generate "train.txt" for training and "cross.txt" for cross validation and generate predictions for "test.txt".
run.sh: Excutable file generated by main.cpp.
Makefile: makefile

Quick Start:

Move "training.txt" and "test.txt" into this folder.
Make.
Run run.sh.


One example of timeSVD++:

linzebing@ufo:~/MMDS/timeSVD++$ make
g++ -std=c++0x -c main.cpp
main.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
main.cpp:28:29: warning: format ‘%s’ expects argument of type ‘char*’, but argument 3 has type ‘char (*)[2048]’ [-Wformat=]
     while (fscanf(fp,"%s",&s)!=EOF) {
                             ^
g++ main.o -o run.sh
